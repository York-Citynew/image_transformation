# Image Transformation
This project focuses on performing transformations on images using matrices.
> ~~**Warning:** Some matrices do not perform well. The bigger problem is that if determinant of the transformation matrix is bigger than 1 imputation is needed.~~
> **Warnin:** There are still some issues with high determinant matrices; Example shown in notebook( 7I ).
- > ~~convolving does not work because of memory error.~~
- > Binning works perefectly, but when using super stertchy matrices the square shaped bins do not help. Example shown in notebook( [[1,2],[3,4]] ).
